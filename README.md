# Circle

This is the circle backend project built by Amo Timothy Kofi. Circle is a platform where students and organizations can request services such as errands, deliveries and many others. This repository contains the code for the backend services for circle such as registrations, messaging and many others. Contributors to this project must follow the laid out code of conduct.

This project is built with Typescript, therefore it's highly recommended for contributors to understand the basics of Typescript in order to contribute well to the development of the service. The project is broken into 2 sections. The web and the backend api. Each of these sections have been explained in details in the README files in the src folder.

## Development

To start development on circle, you need to have Google Cloud account and a firebase account. These can be easily accessed if you have a gmail account.
